> Welcome to my Sudoku puzzle game! - An interactive web Sudoku puzzle game developed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Live Demo

### Motivation
Since I first studied parallel programming, I developed a [personal side project](https://github.com/huaminghuangtw/Parallel-Sudoku-Solver) that aims to solve *large* Sudoku puzzles as efficiently as possible by means of various parallelization techniques and solving algorithms. The main focus/goal of this project, however, is not only to make an *interactive* Sudoku puzzle game that the user can play around with, but also to hone my web development/design skills. Based on [RedFlyer Coding's tutorial video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea3UBpMHDoc&ab_channel=RedFlyerCoding), I've added several widgets and features/functionalities in the webpage which I hope you will enjoy and have fun!ðŸ˜Š

### Description
Sudoku is one of the most popular puzzle games of all time.
The objective of Sudoku is to fill a 9-by-9 grid with digits from 1 to 9 such that each column, row, and box (or called "subgrid", "region", "block") contain every number in the set {1, ... , 9} exactly once.

This web application features **generating** and **solving** standard 9-by-9 Sudoku puzzles of different difficulty levels (i.e., easy, medium, and hard). For the Sudoku generating algorithm, please refer to [1]. The backtracking technique [2] is implemented as the solving algorithm here.

### Test cases
A collection of test grids of various difficulty levels are present in the [`Test_Cases`](./Test_Cases) directory. These text files are used for the **initial** Sudoku boards of respective difficulty levels. When the user clicks the "Refresh puzzle" button, **random** Sudoku boards are subsequently generated via the approach proposed by Rob McGuir [1].
