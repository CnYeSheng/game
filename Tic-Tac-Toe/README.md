# Tic-Tac-Toe
 The classic Tic Tac Toe game written in JavaScript

## For those of you who have no idea what Tic Tac Toe is
 Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game in which the players fill up nine empty rectangles in a table with either an `X` or an `O` when it is their turn. Once someone succeeds to line up their sign vertically, horizontally or diagonally without an interruption, that player wins.
 
### *How to Play*
 Click anywhere on the `3 x 3` grid to start playing by setting the cell in the grid to either `X` or `O`. The game ends when the conditions given above are reached.
 
 There is a multiplayer option as well as an option to play against the computer (*I bet you will find it very difficult to beat it* üôÇ). 
 
 *Note:* **You make the first move as `X` against the computer (when payed in `Player vs Computer` mode).**

 I tried to make the game a little different by adding a `4 x 4` version of it. The only difference being you need to get 4 consecutive `Xs` or `Os` horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
