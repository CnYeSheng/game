<br>

## **Description 📃**
In the 2D Breakout game, you need to break all the bricks using a bouncing ball, a ball that you need to prevent from leaving the game area using the paddle.

## **functionalities 🎮**
<!-- add functionalities over here -->
When the ball hit the paddle, the ball should go in a definite direction based on where the ball hit the paddle so the paddle won't act like a wall. which means you can determine where the ball goes when you hit it with the paddle.

We have the bricks in the game, add a collision detection function, when the ball hit a brick, the brick must disappear and then increment the player's score.

The player has 3 lives, when he loses a life, we reset the ball position and give him a chance to continue playing, when he loses all the 3 lives, it's a game over, we show him a game over message, and a "play again" button to play over.

To win the game, the player has to break all the bricks on each level, and he has to complete 7 levels, when he passes from a level to another, the number of bricks increases and also the speed of the ball.

We have also implement some sounds in the game, and we will create a button for when you want to turn ON/OFF the sounds.
